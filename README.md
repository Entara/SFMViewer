# SFMViewer
Very prototypal code for a SFM Viewer.

The project "IBR - Inschriften im Bezugssystem des Raumes" aimed to make 3D pointcloud data available for research. In our systems "Generic Viewer" and "Spatial Viewer" pointcloud data of terrestrial laser scanning was used. An additional task is to outline a concept to use pointcloud data of structure from motion (SFM) instead. 
This code shows how "SFM Viewer" as a web service could look like and what components are needed. Some first functions are implemented. An interactive Map was created with WebGL and the .js library Three.js. It shows the whole scene with the images used for SFM and also contains textured model and a spare pointcloud of the SFM-object.
